This dataset is great for creating a project focused on either **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** or **Machine Learning (ML)**. Here's a clearer breakdown:

---

### **What You Can Do with EDA**
1. **Summarize the Data**:
   - Check the distribution of age, gender, and other variables.
   - Calculate averages, medians, and ranges for factors like panic attack duration and frequency.

2. **Find Patterns and Relationships**:
   - See if there’s a relationship between sleep hours, caffeine intake, and panic severity scores.
   - Check which triggers (like stress or social anxiety) are most common.

3. **Analyze Symptoms**:
   - Count how many people experience sweating, trembling, or chest pain.
   - Explore how these symptoms vary with panic severity.

4. **Understand Lifestyle Impact**:
   - Compare panic severity for smokers vs. non-smokers or people who attend therapy vs. those who don’t.
   - See how exercise or alcohol consumption relates to panic attack frequency.

### **What You Can Do with Machine Learning**
1. **Predict Panic Severity**:
   - Use features like heart rate, sweating, and caffeine intake to predict the severity score (this is a regression problem).

2. **Classify Triggers**:
   - Predict the likely trigger (e.g., stress, social anxiety) for a panic attack based on other data (this is a classification problem).

3. **Group People with Similar Patterns**:
   - Use clustering (unsupervised learning) to group individuals with similar symptoms, triggers, or lifestyles.

4. **Find Symptom Patterns**:
   - Use ML models to classify if someone will experience specific symptoms (like chest pain or dizziness) during an attack.
