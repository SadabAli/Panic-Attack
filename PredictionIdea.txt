To predict **Panic Severity (Panic_Score)**, you need to focus on features (columns) that most likely influence the severity of a panic attack. Here's what it means in simpler terms:

---

### **Important Features (Columns) to Use**
These are the most useful factors for predicting panic severity:
1. **Panic_Attack_Frequency**: If someone has panic attacks often, their severity might increase.
2. **Duration_Minutes**: Longer panic attacks can indicate higher severity.
3. **Trigger**: Certain triggers (e.g., PTSD or social anxiety) might cause more severe panic attacks.
4. **Heart_Rate**: Higher heart rates during a panic attack could mean greater severity.
5. **Symptoms**:
   - **Sweating**
   - **Shortness_of_Breath**
   - **Dizziness**
   - **Chest_Pain**
   - **Trembling**
   Symptoms are directly tied to the severity of an attack.
6. **Medical_History**: Conditions like anxiety or PTSD can make panic attacks worse.
7. **Caffeine_Intake**: High caffeine intake may worsen panic symptoms for some people.
8. **Exercise_Frequency**: Regular exercise might reduce severity, while inactivity may increase it.
9. **Sleep_Hours**: Poor sleep can lead to worse panic attacks.
10. **Alcohol_Consumption**: Alcohol might aggravate anxiety and panic symptoms.
11. **Smoking**: Smoking can worsen overall health and panic severity.
12. **Therapy**: People in therapy might have less severe attacks compared to those who aren't.

### **Steps to Predict Panic Severity**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and handle missing values in these columns.
   - Convert "Yes/No" or categorical data into numeric format (e.g., use 0 for "No" and 1 for "Yes").
   - Normalize or scale numerical data (like heart rate, duration, etc.).

2. **Model Building**:
   - Use these columns as **features (input)** and **Panic_Score** as the **target (output)**.
   - Train regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, or XGBoost.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Measure the model's performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** or **R-squared** to ensure accurate predictions.
